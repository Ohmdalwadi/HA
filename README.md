# Home Assistant Policy Engine

**Author:** Ohm Dalwadi (S5286342)
**Project:** CSC3105 - Home Automation Policy Engine
**Platform:** Home Assistant OS 2025.10.1

---

## Overview

This project implements an advanced **Policy-Driven Home Automation System** using Home Assistant. Unlike traditional trigger-action automations, this system uses declarative policies with mutually-exclusive modes and stackable overlays to create context-aware, conflict-free automation rules.

### Key Innovation

The **Mode + Overlay Pattern** provides:
- **Base Modes** (mutually exclusive): Home, Away, Sleep, Guest
- **Overlays** (stackable): Work From Home (WFH), Pet at Home
- **Automatic conflict resolution** through policy priorities
- **Energy-aware decision making** with soft budget limits
- **Enhanced explainability** - users can understand "why" the system acts

---

## Features

### 🏠 Base Modes
- **Home Mode**: Bright day profile, normal device operation
- **Away Mode**: Security lockdown, energy conservation, motion alerts
- **Sleep Mode**: Minimal lighting, risky appliance auto-off, door locks
- **Guest Mode**: Extended hallway timeouts, relaxed ambience

### 🔄 Overlay System
- **Work From Home (WFH)**: Focus scene, DND mode, doorbell mute, break reminders (every 30 min)
- **Pet at Home**: Comfort temperature band, bark-calming white noise, dog door management

### ⚡ Energy Management
- **Real-time tracking**: Power-to-energy integration for all devices
- **Daily budget**: Soft block at 80% (disables TV and fun devices)
- **Automatic reset**: Budget resets at midnight
- **Cost calculation**: Live energy cost based on configurable tariff
- **Statistics**: Budget remaining, percentage used, cost today

### 🔒 Security & Safety
- **Smart door locks**: Auto-lock on Away/Sleep, Pet exception (back door unlocked)
- **Appliance timeout**: Kettle auto-off during quiet hours
- **Motion detection**: Auto-away suggestion, welcome home alerts, sleep motion warnings
- **Presence awareness**: 2-hour no-motion triggers Away mode suggestion

### 🐕 Pet Comfort
- **Temperature monitoring**: Alert when lounge temp outside comfort band (18-26°C default)
- **Bark calming**: Auto-enable white noise on sustained barking (10s threshold)
- **Auto-off**: White noise disables 5 minutes after barking stops
- **Doorbell management**: Muted doorbell triggers calming routine

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard
- **4 custom views**: Control, Analytics, Floorplan, Activity Feed
- **Live energy graphs**: Power consumption and daily energy trends
- **Event log**: Time-stamped automation actions
- **Temperature monitoring**: Real-time room temperatures
- **Budget visualization**: Energy budget progress bars

3. Click one of the mode buttons (Home/Away/Sleep/Guest)
4. System will automatically apply the corresponding scene and policies

### Activating Overlays
1. In the **Control** view, find the Overlays section
2. Toggle **Work From Home** for WFH policies
3. Toggle **Pet at Home** for pet comfort policies
4. Overlays can stack with any base mode

### Monitoring Energy

| **Auto-Away Detection** | No motion for 2 hours (Home mode) | Suggests Away mode |

---

## Technical Details

### Policy Resolution Strategy
1. **Mode selection**: User explicitly selects one mode (Home/Away/Sleep/Guest)
2. **Overlay activation**: User toggles overlays (WFH, Pet) independently
3. **Policy evaluation**: Each automation checks mode + overlay state
4. **Action execution**: Highest-priority matching policy executes

### Conflict Resolution Examples

**Scenario 1: Away + Pet Overlay**
- Base Away policy: Lock all doors
- Pet overlay: Unlock back door (dog access)
- **Resolution**: Front locked, back unlocked (Pet takes priority)

**Scenario 2: WFH + Energy Budget**
- WFH policy: Allow all work devices
- Energy policy: Block TV (fun device)
- **Resolution**: TV blocked, kettle allowed (Energy takes priority)

**Scenario 3: Sleep + Motion Detection**
- Sleep policy: Minimal lighting
- Motion overlay: Security alert
- **Resolution**: Keep minimal lighting, send notification (both execute)

### Energy Budget Algorithm
```python
if used_energy >= (budget * 0.8) and not block_fun:
    block_fun = True
    turn_off(tv_switch)
    notify("80% budget reached - TV blocked")

if tv_switch turns ON and block_fun:
    turn_off(tv_switch)
    notify("TV blocked due to energy policy")

at 00:00:01 daily:
    block_fun = False
    notify("Budget reset for new day")
```

### Quiet Hours Midnight Boundary
```yaml
# Correctly handles time ranges that wrap midnight (e.g., 23:00 - 06:00)
{% if start_time > end_time %}
  # Wraps midnight
  {{ now >= start_time or now <= end_time }}
{% else %}
  # Same day
  {{ now >= start_time and now <= end_time }}
{% endif %}
```

## Testing

### Automated Test Scenarios

| Test | Initial State | Action | Expected Result | Pass/Fail |
|------|---------------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **T1** | Mode: Home | Toggle Away | Away mode active, all others off | ✅ Pass |
| **T2** | Mode: Away | Motion ON | "Welcome home" notification | ✅ Pass |
| **T3** | Energy: 0 kWh | Use 4.1 kWh | TV blocked, notification sent | ✅ Pass |
| **T4** | WFH: OFF | Toggle WFH ON | Doorbell muted, DND active | ✅ Pass |
| **T5** | Bark: 0 dB | Set 70 dB for 10s | White noise ON | ✅ Pass |
| **T6** | Bark: 70 dB → 0 dB | Wait 5 min | White noise OFF | ✅ Pass |
| **T7** | Time: 23:30, Kettle ON | Wait 30 min | Kettle turns OFF | ✅ Pass |
| **T8** | All motion OFF | Wait 2 hours | Auto-away suggestion | ✅ Pass |

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] All 4 modes mutually exclusive
- [ ] WFH overlay enables DND and mutes doorbell
- [ ] Pet overlay triggers white noise on bark (10s, >60dB)
- [ ] White noise auto-off after 5 min no bark
- [ ] Energy budget blocks TV at 80%
- [ ] Energy budget resets at midnight
- [ ] Break reminder fires every 30 min (not every 1 min)
- [ ] Quiet hours handles midnight boundary (23:00-06:00)
- [ ] Motion sensors trigger presence automations
- [ ] All 5 scenes have populated entity states

## Known Limitations

1. **Simulated Environment**: All sensors/actuators are virtual (input_boolean/input_number)
2. **No Physical Hardware**: Requires production integration (Zigbee/Z-Wave) for real devices
3. **Single User**: No multi-user presence detection or personalization
4. **No Voice Control**: No Alexa/Google Assistant integration (can be added)
5. **Basic Floorplan**: Uses 2D picture-elements card (could upgrade to SVG)

---

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Add actionable notifications (buttons to accept auto-away suggestion)
- [ ] Integrate real Zigbee motion sensors (Philips Hue)
- [ ] Add voice control via Home Assistant Cloud
- [ ] Create history statistics (7-day energy trends)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Multi-user presence (device_tracker integration)
- [ ] Advanced ML anomaly detection (unusual energy patterns)
- [ ] Custom Lovelace theme with animations
- [ ] Mobile app dashboard optimization

### Low Priority
- [ ] Integration with external calendar for auto-WFH mode
- [ ] Weather-based HVAC adjustments
- [ ] Predictive energy budgeting (ML model)
- [ ] Voice announcements via TTS

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Scenes don't apply when mode changes
**Solution**: Check that scene names match exactly in automations. All scenes are now populated with device states.

### Issue: Break reminder fires every minute instead of every 30 minutes
**Solution**: This was a bug in earlier versions. Updated to `minutes: "/30"` in line 449 of sim_policy_plus.yaml.

### Issue: Energy budget never resets
**Solution**: Added new automation "Energy | Daily Budget Reset" that fires at 00:00:01 daily.

### Issue: White noise stays on forever after bark calming
**Solution**: Added new automation "Pet | Bark Calming Auto-Off" that disables white noise 5 minutes after barking stops.

### Issue: Quiet hours don't work from 23:00 to 06:00
**Solution**: Fixed midnight boundary logic in "Safety | Quiet Hours Auto-Off" automation (lines 337-352).

### Issue: Motion sensors don't trigger any automations
**Solution**: Added 3 new presence detection automations: auto-away detection, welcome home, and sleep motion alert.
